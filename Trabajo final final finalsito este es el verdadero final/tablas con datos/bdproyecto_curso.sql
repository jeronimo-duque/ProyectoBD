From the earliest days of the profession, Luca Pacioli emphasized the importance of math and order for analyzing business transactions. The skillset that accountants have needed to perform math and to keep order has evolved from pencil and paper, to typewriters and calculators, then to spreadsheets and accounting software. A new skillset that is becoming more important for nearly every aspect of business is that of big data analytics: analyzing large amounts of data to find actionable insights. This course is designed to help accounting students develop an analytical mindset and prepare them to use data analytic programming languages like Python and R. We?ve divided the course into three main sections. In the first section, we bridge accountancy to analytics. We identify how tasks in the five major subdomains of accounting (i.e., financial, managerial, audit, tax, and systems) have historically required an analytical mindset, and we then explore how those tasks can be completed more effectively and efficiently by using big data analytics. We then present a FACT framework for guiding big data analytics: Frame a question, Assemble data, Calculate the data, and Tell others about the results. In the second section of the course, we emphasize the importance of assembling data. Using financial statement data, we explain desirable characteristics of both data and datasets that will lead to effective calculations and visualizations. In the third, and largest section of the course, we demonstrate and explore how Excel and Tableau can be used to analyze big data. We describe visual perception principles and then apply those principles to create effective visualizations. We then examine fundamental data analytic tools, such as regression, linear programming (using Excel Solver), and clustering in the context of point of sale data and loan data. We conclude by demonstrating the power of data analytic programming languages to assemble, visualize, and analyze data. We introduce Visual Basic for Applications as an example of a programming language, and the Visual Basic Editor as an example of an integrated development environment (IDE).','6 may. 2021','Ingl‚s','0',NULL,'0','0','0'),('COURSERA_18009','Y','Coursera','Corporativa','0','0','Enlace','VIRTUAL',NULL,'0','Welcome to Course 2 - Sales Strategy - This course is designed to discuss the application of intelligence analysis in the sales planning process. And this approach contributes to integrating the sales planning process into the corporate strategy of the company because, in the strategy analysis and formulation process, we apply models, frameworks, tools, and techniques that also apply to the sales planning and management process. Therefore, the expected outcomes of this course focus on the transition from traditional to strategic sales planning, by discussing and applying the concepts recommended to support the development of the strategic guidelines. The concepts, models, tools, and techniques discussed and practiced during the course focus on the improvement of value creation from the sales function empowered by intelligence analysis, a process which typically applies in the strategy analysis front. The discussions go through how intelligence analysis can support the sales function, by providing methods to connect strategy to marketing and sales planning processes. In this course, the primary learning outcome is the ability to apply intelligence analysis to support sales planning process, and by being able to do this, you?ll improve your competencies and skills to support sales planning with a strategic approach. You?ll develop a final assignment at the end of the course, and it is designed from an adapted real-life business case.

Adaptability is what allows people and businesses to solve problems, overcome challenges and move back from the edge of attrition to the more stable ground of relevance. Adaptability is everything. ? Jeff Boss, Forbes Adaptability refers to your ability change your actions, course, or approach in order to suit different conditions or environments. Adaptability implies a sense of personal choice, of purposefully navigating?rather than being driven by?changing circumstances. Resilience is the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties. Resilience gives you the ability to bounce forward with new insights and learning you can carry into the future. Both adaptability and resilience include the ability to assess an evolving situation from multiple perspectives, to shift thinking and viewpoint, and to choose the best response. Adaptable people flourish amidst chaos while inflexible people flounder. Adapters find openings in situations where others only see closure. This 4-module course will give you knowledge and tools to become more adaptable and resilient in your workplace and in your life.','2 jun. 2022','frances','0',NULL,'0','0','0'),('COURSERA_46002','Y','Coursera','TI','0','0','Enlace','VIRTUAL',NULL,'0','By the end of this project, you will learn how to use Sketch Up for web to model simple 3D objects 3D modeling is largely used in the design fields, to represent interiors, products, games. In 3D computer graphics, 3D modeling is meant as the process of developing a mathematical representation of any surface of an object in three dimensions via modeling software. The product of this process is called a 3D model. This model can also be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering or used in computer simulations. Nowadays thanks to the use of 3D printers modelers are able to physically create the 3D model. SketchUp for Web is a free version of SketchUp that runs in a web browser. It shows a simple interface where anyone can simply draw and create 3D models. This makes 3D modeling accessible and easy to use to anyone interested in exploring this field. This guided project is for students, graphic designers, illustrators, or artists who want to explore SketchUp for Web as a free tool to try 3D modeling. Anyone interested in exploring 3D modeling.','2 dic. 2022','holandes','0',NULL,'0','0','0'),('COURSERA_46003','Y','Coursera','Corporativa','0','0','Enlace','VIRTUAL',NULL,'0','This course is the first in a series of six to equip you with the skills you need to apply to introductory-level roles in project management.
